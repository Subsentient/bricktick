Bricktick is an curses based Arkanoid/Brickbreaker clone for UNIX.
It uses gmake so make sure you are using gmake if not on Linux.
It requires curses and that's about it really. Color is recommended.

0.8: Second release.

Compiling: Type make. If that fails, you can just link all the C files 
together and link them with curses. Passing -ansi to the compiler is 
recommended.
